# Week 3. Research Assignment 1


Assignment Background:
There is a burgeoning market for AI assistants and agents that offers opportunities for data scientists and data engineers. Before embarking upon a consulting or product development opportunity in this field, it may be a good idea to conduct a competitive review of the marketplace.
Consider the challenges facing new product developers in this domain. There can be substantial software development costs. Following Porter's Five Forces Model, a company may want to consider market factors prior to embarking upon a major design and development effort.
Supplier power. There may be software dependencies on systems provided by the major players, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, and Meta/Facebook. 
Threat of entry. Cloud resources allow easy entry not only for your startup, but also for other startups operating in the same product or service category. 
Substitute products. Here we need to think broadly about the many systems that may be employed to provide similar value to clients/customers. This includes traditional (non-AI) systems that have been operational for many years. 



Management Problem
Problem: A Fortune 500 company involved in financial services is looking for a data scientist to help in exploring AI product opportunities. In particular, it would like to learn more about the application of AI within corporate information infrastructure, specifically focusing on leaders and emerging players in this field. 




The company is interested in understanding the current landscape, emerging technologies, and new growth opportunities, with a focus on financial services. 
Are other financial services firms utilizing AI and to what extent? 
Provide insights into existing players, emerging technologies, and potential growth areas in AI for financial services
The company is considering a number of potential new product opportunities, such as automated trading, stock-broker agents, and financial advisors.
Conversational agents that can quickly provide stock quotes and financial analysis are also being considered. 
The company is aware of contemporary developments in financial machine learning and may be able to provide such services directly to its clients.
Financial machine learning is an active area algorithmic trading, as can be seen in a quick search of Amazon shows. 
It is possible that the company will be building a system for linking financial clients directly with a conversational agent.


This represents a significant consulting opportunity for you. To secure the engagement, in addition to documenting your qualifications through your resume, personal website, and code repositories from past projects, the firm is looking for a preliminary report that shows you have a firm grasp of the information technology space that comprises AI. The report needs to go beyond what traditional technology evaluation firms provide. The report needs to go beyond what GenAI tools can provide. That is, demonstrate the special expertise you have acquired as an MSDS student and data science practitioner.
